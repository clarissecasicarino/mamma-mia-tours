## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Usage
 - Since this is a component-based project, we place all of our components inside the app/components directory.
 - If you want to customize CSS styling, head over to tailwind.config.js in the root directory. Certain breakpoints have already been set so you can use them for a more responsive user experience (e.g. mobile, mobileLarge, tablet, laptop, desktop).
